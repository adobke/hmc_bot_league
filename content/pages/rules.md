Title: League Rules

These rules are based on the Robot Fighting League Standard Ruleset.

1.    General
    1.	All participants build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulation that can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care to not hurt yourself or others when building, testing and competing. 
    2.	This rule set is designed to for adjustment by each event depending on its safety concerns. 
    3.	If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in someway ambiguous or borderline, please contact this event. Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the event staff with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it ever competes. 
    4.	Compliance with all event rules is mandatory. It is expected that competitors stay within the rules and procedures of their own accord and do not require constant policing. 
    5.	Each event has safety inspections. It is at their sole discretion that your robot is allowed to compete. As a builder you are obligated to disclose all operating principles and potential dangers to the inspection staff. 
    6.	Cardinal Safety Rules: Failure to comply with any of the following rules could result in expulsion or worse, injury and death. 
     1.	Radios may not be turned on at or near events for any purpose without obtaining the appropriate frequency clip or explicit permission from the event. 
     2.	Proper activation and deactivation of robots is critical. Robots must only be activated in the arena, testing areas, or with expressed consent of the event and it's safety officials. 
     3.	All robots must be able to be FULLY deactivated, which includes power to drive and weaponry, in under 60 seconds by a manual disconnect.
     4.	All robots not in an arena or official testing area must be raised or blocked up in a manner so that their wheels or legs cannot cause movement if the robot were turned on. Runaway bots are VERY dangerous. 
     5.	Locking devices: Moving weapons that can cause damage or injury must have a clearly visible locking device in place at all times when not in the arena. Locking devices must be painted in neon orange or another high-visibility color. Locking devices must be clearly capable to stopping, arresting or otherwise preventing harmful motion of the weapon.
     6.	Weapon locking pins must be in place when weapon power is applied during a robot's power-on procedure. This includes all powered weapons regardless of the power source or weight class. 
     7.	It is expected that all builders will follow basic safety practices during work on the robot at your pit station. Please be alert and aware of your pit neighbors and people passing by.


2. Weight Classes. This event offers the listed weight classes in section 2.1. There is a 100% weight bonus for walking bots as defined by 3.1.3 below. (There is no weight bonus for any bot not defined as walking in 3.1.3, including shuffling, linear-actuation, gyroscopic procession, flying, or other forms of locomotion which are predicated on rolling. 
  1.  Weight classes and Bonuses:

Regular	| Walking
--------|--------
150 gram | 300 gram
1 pound | 2 pound
3 pound	| 6 pound
30 pound | 60 pound
60 Pound | 120 Pound
120 pound | 240 pound
220 pound | 440 pound


  2.	 Event-specific Weight Classes and Bonuses. This event does not define any additional weight classes or bonuses.
  3.	 1 & 3 lb Autonomous Combat: This event offers a separate class for 1 & 3 lb autonomous fighting robots.
    1.	Arena: The 1 & 3 lb Autonomous class fights in an 6' x 6' polycarbinate enclosed arena with a 5' x 5' black fighting surface surrounded by a 2" wide white border.
    2.	Autonomous robots must be fully autonomous. Use of a radio-control device for failsafe is allowed but it must provide NO OTHER FUNCTION than a failsafe signal.
      1.	Robots are started and stopped by use of the above failsafe.
      2.	Robots must stop motion and weapons when failsafe is activated, for safe removal from arena.
   3.	Autonomous robots must be self-contained, with all sensors and computing resources on-board and included in the weight. External sensors, computers, etc. are not allowed.
   4.	The additional Autonomous robot rules found in Section 5 apply to the 1 & 3 lb Autonomous class.
