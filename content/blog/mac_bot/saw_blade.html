{% mark excerpt -%}
The mac bot needed teeth.  What fits well in a mac mini? 
It turns the CD drive slot is the perfect size for a saw blade. Here
are the results of the first brushless saw blade prototype.

<p>
Hobby brushless motors are a wonderous thing. From this link 60 gram motor (LINK)
around 200 watts of power are produced.  What would happen if you link that up with a 
saw blade meant for cutting metal?  It should make for a pretty mean combat robot weapon.
<p>
This first prototype is made from a 3d printed frame, a 5/16" bolt, and abec 7 skateboard
bearings.  The two pulleys, linked together with a polyurethane belt (LINK),
were made on a lathe using a button tool (LINK) giving a gear
ratio of ~2:1. Add to that the motor at 980 KV (rpm/volt) running off of a 11.1V lipo battery and 
we get a saw blade spinning at ~5000 rpm.

 With full safety precautions in mind... we clamped the setup to a nearby metal railing and fired it up:
 frightening! The tiny brushless motor has no problem spinning up the blade to full speed - on the other hand
 the 3d printed frame and old railing were rather rattly; the blade and pulleys are likely unbalanced.

 First up: piece of wood and some plastic.

 No problem
