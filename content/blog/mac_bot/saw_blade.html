The mac bot needed teeth.  What fits well in a mac mini? 
It turns the CD drive slot is the perfect size for a saw blade. Here
are the results of the first brushless saw blade prototype.

Hobby brushless motors are a wonderous thing. This tiny
<a href = "http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__30854__Turnigy_Aerodrive_SK3_2830_920kv_Brushless_Outrunner_Motor_USA_warehouse_.html">60 gram motor</a>
 is rated for around 150 watts of power.  What would happen if you hooked that up to a 
saw blade meant for cutting metal?  It should make for a pretty mean combat robot weapon.
<p>
This first prototype is made from a 3d printed frame, a 5/16" bolt, and two abec 7 skateboard
bearings.  The two pulleys, linked together with a 
<a href="http://www.mcmaster.com/nav/enter.asp?partnum=3044K503">urethane belt</a>,
were made on a lathe using a button tool giving a gear
ratio of ~2:1. Add to that the motor at 980 KV (rpm/volt) running off of a 11.1V lipo battery and 
the saw blade spins at ~5000 rpm.

 With full safety precautions in mind... we clamped the setup to a nearby metal railing and fired it up:
 frightening! The tiny brushless motor has no problem spinning up the blade to full speed - on the other hand
 the 3d printed frame and old railing were rather rattly; the blade and pulleys are likely unbalanced.

 First up: piece of wood and some plastic - no problem. Aluminium - surprisingly easy... Steel plate - Wow!  Not
 bad for a tiny little motor, 3d printed frame, and a harbour freight saw blade, and it sounds like a real saw blade.

 Next up: get everything mounted inside the mac bot frame.
